Create an invoice with `POST /v1/invoices`. You must send the customer’s **email** (a user in your entity), at least one **items** entry, and a **payment_schedule** (due date, send date, payment methods, optional reminders). You can add **charges** (tax, discount, fee, shipping) and a **note**.

## Required fields

- **email** — Email of the user you’re invoicing (they must exist in your entity).
- **items** — Array of line items. Each has **name**, **unit_price**, **quantity**, **currency**, **total** (usually unit_price × quantity).
- **payment_schedule** — Object with:
  - **type** — `"one_time"` or `"re_occurring"`.
  - **due_date** — When payment is due (ISO date-time).
  - **send_date** — When the invoice is considered sent (ISO date-time).
  - **payment_methods** — Array of `{ "id": "bank_transfer", "value": "058" }` (or other method + value).
  - Optionally **reminders** (boolean) and **reminder_timing** (e.g. `{ "type": "before_due_date", "days": 3 }`).
  - For re_occurring: **repeat**, **interval** (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly), **end**.

## Response

The response **data** includes **id** (invoice UID), **invoice_number** (e.g. INV20260130001), **items**, **subtotal**, **total**, **charges**, **note**, **status** (e.g. pending, paid, cancelled), **payment_schedule**, and **created_at**. Share the **invoice_number** with the customer so they can view and pay (e.g. GET `/v1/invoices/view/INV20260130001`).

## Line items and charges

- **items** — Each item needs name, unit_price, quantity, currency, and total. Subtotal/total can be derived from these; the API may apply **charges** (tax, discount, etc.) when configured.
- **charges** — Optional. Each charge has **amount**, **type** (flat or percentage), and **enabled**. Use this for tax, discount, fee, or shipping.
