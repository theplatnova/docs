Verify payment status and track payment processing. This guide covers how to check payment status and handle payment verification.

## Verifying Payment Status

Check the status of a payment using its reference:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.platnova.com/v1/payments/verify \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reference": "PAY001"
  }'
```

## Verification Response

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "transaction_id": "txn_123",
    "payment_reference": "PAY001",
    "amount": "500.00",
    "currency": "USD",
    "recipient_account_number": "1234567890",
    "recipient_name": "Jane Smith",
    "status": "success",
    "processed_at": "2025-01-30T10:05:00Z",
    "created_at": "2025-01-30T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "message": "Payment verified successfully"
}
```

## Payment Statuses

### Processing

Payment has been initiated and is being processed. This is the initial status for most payments.

```json
{
  "status": "processing",
  "message": "Payment is being processed"
}
```

### Success

Payment completed successfully. Funds have been transferred to the recipient.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "processed_at": "2025-01-30T10:05:00Z"
}
```

### Failed

Payment failed. Check error details for the reason.

```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "Insufficient funds",
  "error_code": "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS"
}
```

## Common Failure Reasons

- **Insufficient Funds** - Not enough balance in source wallet
- **Invalid Account** - Recipient account number or bank code invalid
- **Account Mismatch** - Account name doesn't match account number
- **Bank Rejection** - Recipient bank rejected the payment
- **Network Error** - Temporary network or processing error

## Verification Best Practices

### When to Verify

- After sending a payment
- Periodically for pending payments
- Before showing payment confirmation to users
- When handling payment webhooks

### Verification Frequency

- Check immediately after sending
- Retry failed verifications after a delay
- Don't poll too frequently (respect rate limits)
- Use webhooks for real-time updates when possible

## Handling Payment Status

### Processing Payments

- Show "processing" status to users
- Set up retry logic for status checks
- Don't mark as complete until status is "success"

### Successful Payments

- Update your records
- Send confirmation to users
- Generate receipts if needed

### Failed Payments

- Log error details
- Notify users of failure
- Provide retry options if appropriate
- Handle refunds if needed

## Webhook Integration

Set up webhooks to receive real-time payment status updates:

```json
{
  "event": "payment.status.updated",
  "data": {
    "transaction_id": "txn_123",
    "payment_reference": "PAY001",
    "status": "success",
    "processed_at": "2025-01-30T10:05:00Z"
  }
}
```
