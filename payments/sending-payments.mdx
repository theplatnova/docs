Send money transfers using multiple payment methods. This guide covers how to send payments and track their status.

## Sending a Payment

Send a payment by specifying the payment method and recipient details in `info`. Example for a bank transfer:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.platnova.com/v1/payments/send \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from_amount": 500.00,
    "from_wallet_id": "wl_your_wallet_id",
    "to_currency": "NGN",
    "payment_method": "bank_transfer",
    "info": {
      "account_number": "0123456789",
      "bank_code": "058",
      "account_name": "Jane Smith"
    },
    "reference": "PAY001",
    "payment_type": { "type": "instant" }
  }'
```

## Payment Parameters

- **payment_method** – One of: `bank_transfer`, `card`, `mobile_money`, `wallet`, `tag_transfer`, `defi`, `revolut`, `paypal`, `cashapp`, `zelle`
- **info** – Recipient details; required fields depend on `payment_method` (e.g. for `bank_transfer`: `account_number`, `bank_code`, `account_name`; for `tag_transfer`: `tag_id`)

## Payment Response

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "transaction_id": "txn_123",
    "payment_reference": "PAY001",
    "amount": "500.00",

## Payment Status

Payments are processed asynchronously. Status can be:

- **Processing** - Payment is being processed
- **Success** - Payment completed successfully

## Verifying Payment Status

Check payment status using the transaction reference returned from send:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.platnova.com/v1/payments/verify \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ref": "UTR_xxxx"
  }'
```
