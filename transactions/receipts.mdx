You can generate a receipt for any transaction. The API returns a receipt as base64-encoded data (typically a PDF), which you can decode, save, or send to your customer.

## How it works

Call `GET /v1/transactions/{id}/receipt` with the transaction ID (the same `id` you get when listing transactions). The response is JSON: the `data` field contains the receipt as a base64 string. Decode it to get the PDF (or other format) and store or email it as needed.

## Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.platnova.com/v1/transactions/trx_43a2b75e-5c59-429e-872a-2a54c7b17e34/receipt" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Use the transaction UID from your [transaction list](/transactions/viewing)—for example `trx_43a2b75e-5c59-429e-872a-2a54c7b17e34`.

## Response

The response body is standard API envelope: `status`, `data`, `error`, `message`. The receipt content is in `data` as a base64-encoded string (e.g. a PDF). Decode it in your app to save or display the file.

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": "JVBERi0xLjQKJeLjz9MK...",
  "error": [],
  "message": "operation was successful"
}
```

If the transaction is not found or the ID is invalid, you get a 400 with an error message.

## When to use it

- **Customer records** — Generate a receipt after a successful payment and email or show it to the payer.
- **Accounting** — Decode and store receipts in your system for reconciliation and audits.
- **Disputes** — Use the receipt as proof of transaction details when handling chargebacks or support.
