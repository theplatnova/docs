## Get Your API Key

Create an API key for your workspace. You can find it in the [API Keys section](https://business.platnova.com/settings/developer) of your dashboard.

<Tip>
Contact our support team at [support@platnova.com](mailto:support@platnova.com) for personalized onboarding assistance, especially if you're integrating with high transaction volumes or need custom configurations.
</Tip>

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "user_123", "spending_limit": 1000}'
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Keep your API key secure** - Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories
- **Use environment variables** - Store your API key in secure environment variables
- **Rotate keys regularly** - Generate new keys periodically for enhanced security
- **Monitor usage** - Check your dashboard regularly for unusual activity
- **Use webhooks securely** - Validate webhook signatures to ensure data integrity

## Rate Limits

Account creation is free. Paid plans include higher limits and priority processing. Check your current plan in the [dashboard](https://business.platnova.com/settings/billing).
