Welcome to the Platnova Business API Reference. Our RESTful API provides programmatic access to virtual accounts, cards, payments, and other financial services, allowing you to integrate Platnova's capabilities into your business applications.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

**Production:**
```
https://api.platnova.com
```

**Sandbox:**
```
https://sandbox.api.platnova.co
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your API key. You can include it either in the request headers or as a query parameter.

### Header Authentication (Recommended)
```bash
X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Query Parameter Authentication
```bash
?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Some endpoints require JWT authentication in addition to API key authentication. See our [Authentication guide](../authentication) for details on obtaining and using your API key.

## Request Format

All requests should include the following headers:
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY` (or include as query parameter)

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format with the following structure:

### Success Response
```json
{
    "status": true,
    "data": {
        // Response data here
    },
    "error": [],
    "message": "operation was successful"
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
    "status": false,
    "data": {},
    "error": [],
    "message": "Error message here"
}
```

### Validation Error Response
```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Validation failed",
    "errors": {
        "field_name": [
            "This field is required"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Rate Limits

Rate limits vary by endpoint and are indicated in response headers:
- `X-Ratelimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per window
- `X-Ratelimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-Ratelimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets (Unix timestamp)

Some endpoints have specific rate limits:
- Card creation: 4 requests per window
- Card reveal: 10 requests per window
- Virtual account creation: 2 requests per window

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request (invalid parameters or resource not found)
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid API key)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found
- `422` - Unprocessable Entity (validation errors)
- `429` - Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

See our [Error Handling guide](../errors) for detailed error information.

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination using query parameters:

- `page`: 0-indexed page number (default: 0)
- `size`: Number of items per page (default: 10)
- `sort`: Sort order (optional)
- `filters`: Filter criteria (optional)

Response includes pagination metadata:
```json
{
    "page": 0,
    "size": 10,
    "max_page": 5,
    "total_pages": 6,
    "total": 60,
    "last": false,
    "first": true,
    "visible": 10
}
```
