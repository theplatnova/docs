Onboard customers quickly and efficiently with our streamlined customer creation process. This guide covers the essential steps for creating customer profiles and preparing them for service.

## Creating a Customer

Create a new customer with basic information:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.platnova.com/v1/customers \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "country_code": "US"
  }'
```

## Required Information

### Basic Details

- **First Name** - Customer's first name
- **Last Name** - Customer's last name
- **Email** - Valid email address
- **Phone** - Phone number with country code
- **Country Code** - ISO country code (e.g., US, NG, GB)

### Optional Information

- **Date of Birth** - For age verification
- **Address** - Billing or residential address
- **Metadata** - Custom data for your records

## Customer Response

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "customer_123",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "country_code": "US",
    "status": "approval_pending",
    "created_at": "2025-01-30T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "message": "Customer created successfully"
}
```

## Customer Status

After creation, customers typically start with "approval_pending" status. This means they're created but may need KYC verification before they can receive services.

### Status Flow

1. **Approval Pending** - Customer created, awaiting verification
2. **Active** - Customer verified and can receive services
3. **Locked** - Customer account is locked
4. **Restricted** - Customer has restrictions on their account

## Next Steps After Creation

Once a customer is created, you can:

- Issue cards to the customer
- Create virtual accounts for the customer
- Send payments to the customer
- Track customer transactions

## Retrieving Customer Information

Get customer details at any time:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.platnova.com/v1/customers/{customer_id} \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Listing Customers
