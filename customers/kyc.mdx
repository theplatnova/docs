Know Your Customer (KYC) verification ensures compliance with financial regulations and helps prevent fraud. This guide covers the KYC process and how to manage customer verification.

## What is KYC?

KYC (Know Your Customer) is a process that verifies the identity of customers before they can use financial services. It helps ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and prevents fraud.

## KYC Requirements

KYC verification typically requires:

- **Identity Verification** - Government-issued ID (passport, driver's license, national ID)
- **Address Verification** - Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement)
- **Biometric Verification** - In some cases, biometric data may be required

## Customer Status and KYC

Customer status reflects their KYC verification state:

- **Approval Pending** - Customer created but KYC not yet verified
- **Active** - KYC verified, customer can use services
- **Locked** - KYC verification failed or account locked
- **Restricted** - Customer has restrictions due to KYC issues

## Checking Customer Status

Monitor customer KYC status:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.platnova.com/v1/customers/{customer_id} \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The response includes the customer's current status and any KYC-related information.

## KYC Verification Process

### Step 1: Customer Creation

Create the customer with basic information:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.platnova.com/v1/customers \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "country_code": "US"
  }'
```

### Step 2: Submit KYC Documents

Submit required KYC documents through your dashboard or via API. Documents are verified automatically or manually depending on your configuration.

### Step 3: Verification Complete

Once verified, the customer status changes to "active" and they can receive cards, virtual accounts, and other services.

## KYC Compliance

### Why KYC Matters

- **Regulatory Compliance** - Required by financial regulations
- **Fraud Prevention** - Helps prevent identity theft and fraud
- **Risk Management** - Reduces risk of money laundering and other illegal activities

### Best Practices

- Collect all required KYC information during onboarding
- Verify documents promptly to avoid delays
- Keep KYC documents secure and confidential
- Monitor customer status regularly
- Update KYC information when customer details change

## Handling KYC Failures

If KYC verification fails:

1. Customer status may change to "locked" or "restricted"
2. Review the reason for failure
3. Request additional documentation if needed
4. Resubmit for verification
