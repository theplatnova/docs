Virtual accounts allow you to create bank accounts for your customers that can receive payments directly. Each virtual account is linked to a customer and can receive funds from any source, making it easy to collect payments from customers, vendors, or other parties.

## What Are Virtual Accounts?

Virtual accounts are bank accounts created programmatically for your customers. They function like regular bank accounts and can receive payments from any source. Funds received into virtual accounts are automatically credited to your business wallet, giving you full control over the funds.

## Key Features

### Instant Account Creation

Create virtual accounts instantly for your customers with a simple API call. Accounts are provisioned immediately and can receive payments right away.

### Multi-Currency Support

Create accounts in multiple currencies including USD, NGN, and other supported currencies. Each account operates in a single currency, but customers can have multiple accounts in different currencies.

### Multiple Account Types

Virtual accounts support different account types including current accounts and savings accounts. The account type depends on the currency and provider.

### Bank Account Details

Each virtual account includes complete bank account details such as account number, account name, bank name, routing numbers (for USD accounts), and SWIFT codes for international transfers.

### Payment Collection

Customers can receive payments directly into their virtual accounts. Funds are automatically credited to your business wallet, giving you full visibility and control.

## Account Lifecycle

### Creating Accounts

When you create a virtual account, you specify the currency and the customer it's assigned to. The account is created instantly with complete bank details that can be shared with payers.

### Receiving Payments

Payments can be sent to virtual accounts from any source. The account details (account number, bank name, routing numbers) are provided to the payer, who can then send funds using standard bank transfer methods.

### Account Management

Each customer can have multiple virtual accounts in different currencies. Accounts can be listed, queried, and managed through the API.

- Account number
