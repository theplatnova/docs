Platnova provides two distinct environments to support your development workflow: a sandbox environment for testing and a live environment for production use.

## Environment Comparison

| Feature | Sandbox Environment | Live Environment |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Base URL** | `https://sandbox.api.platnova.co` | `https://api.platnova.com` |
| **Purpose** | Development, testing, and integration | Production use with real transactions |
| **Data Type** | Test data (simulated) | Real data (actual money and accounts) |
| **Approval** | No approval needed | Production approval required |

<Tip>
Always test your integration thoroughly in the sandbox environment before moving to production.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Only use the live environment after thorough testing in sandbox and receiving approval from our compliance team.

## API Keys

Each environment requires separate API keys. Your sandbox and live API keys are managed independently in your dashboard.

<Info>
Sandbox API keys are clearly marked and cannot be used in the live environment. Similarly, live API keys cannot be used in sandbox.
</Info>

## Webhooks

Both environments support Webhooks.

<Check>
Configure webhooks for both environments to ensure your integration works seamlessly when moving to production.

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are more generous in the sandbox environment to support development and testing:

- **Sandbox**: Higher limits for testing and development
- **Live**: Standard production limits based on your plan
