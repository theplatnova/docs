Manage card balances by depositing funds from your wallet or withdrawing funds back to your wallet. These operations help you control spending and manage card balances effectively.

## Funding Cards

Add funds to a card from your business wallet. Deposits are processed instantly and the card balance is updated immediately.

### Depositing Funds

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards/{card_id}/deposit \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "250.00"
  }'
```

### Deposit Requirements

- Funds must be available in your wallet

  }'
```

### Withdrawal Requirements

### Withdrawal Response

  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "transaction_id": "txn_789",
    "card_id": "card_456",
    "amount": "150.00",

## Checking Card Balance

View the current balance of a card:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards/{card_id} \

```

The response includes the current balance in the card's currency.

View all deposit and withdrawal transactions for a card:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards/{card_id}/events \
