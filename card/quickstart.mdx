Get started with virtual cards in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through creating your first card, funding it, and making a purchase.

## Prerequisites

- A Platnova account ([sign up here](https://business.platnova.com))
- An API key (see [Authentication](/authentication))
- A customer created in your system

## Step 1: Create a Customer

Before creating a card, you need to have a customer in your system:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.platnova.com/v1/customers \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "country_code": "US"
  }'
```

## Step 2: Create a Card

Create a virtual card for your customer:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "customer_id_from_step_1",
    "currency": "USD",
    "brand": "mastercard",
    "amount": "100.00"
  }'
```

## Step 3: Fund the Card

Add funds to your card from your wallet:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards/{card_id}/deposit \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "500.00"
  }'
```

## Step 4: View Card Details

Retrieve card information including card number and CVV:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards/{card_id}/reveal \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Step 5: Monitor Card Activity

View all transactions and events for your card:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards/{card_id}/events \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Example Response

```json

  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "card_123",
    "customer_id": "customer_456",
    "currency": "USD",
