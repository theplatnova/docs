Manage your cards effectively with freeze, unfreeze, and status controls. These features help you maintain security and control over card usage.

## Freezing Cards

Freeze a card to temporarily disable it. Frozen cards cannot be used for purchases until they are unfrozen.

### When to Freeze a Card

- Suspected unauthorized activity
- Employee termination or leave
- Lost or stolen card reports
- Temporary spending restrictions needed

### Freezing a Card

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards/{card_id}/freeze \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The card status will change to "frozen" and all attempts to use it will be declined.

## Unfreezing Cards

Unfreeze a card to restore its functionality. The card can be used immediately after unfreezing.

### Unfreezing a Card

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards/{card_id}/unfreeze \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The card status will change back to "active" and normal usage can resume.

## Checking Card Status

Retrieve the current status of a card:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards/{card_id} \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Card Statuses

- **active** - Card is active and can be used
- **frozen** - Card is frozen and cannot be used
- **cancelled** - Card has been cancelled permanently

## Card Information

View complete card details including masked card number, expiration date, and balance:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards/{card_id} \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Revealing Card Details

For security, card numbers and CVVs are masked by default. Use the reveal endpoint to get the full card details:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.platnova.com/v1/cards/{card_id}/reveal \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Note:** The reveal endpoint is rate-limited to prevent abuse. Use it only when necessary.

## Best Practices

- Freeze cards immediately if suspicious activity is detected
- Regularly review card status and balances
- Use unfreeze only when you're certain the card should be active
- Keep card details secure and never expose CVVs unnecessarily
