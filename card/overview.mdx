Virtual cards allow you to issue cards to your customers, employees, or vendors with spending controls and real-time transaction monitoring. Cards can be created instantly and managed programmatically through our API.

## What Are Virtual Cards?

Virtual cards are digital payment cards that can be used for online and in-store purchases. Each card is linked to a customer and can be funded from your business wallet. Cards support multiple currencies and can be frozen, unfrozen, or have funds withdrawn as needed.

## Key Features

### Instant Card Creation

Create cards instantly for your customers with a simple API call. Cards are provisioned immediately and can be used right away for online purchases.

### Multi-Currency Support

Issue cards in multiple currencies including USD, NGN, and other supported currencies. Each card operates in a single currency, but you can create multiple cards for different currencies.

### Spending Controls

Manage card spending through various controls including balance limits, transaction limits, and merchant restrictions. Cards can be frozen instantly to prevent unauthorized use.

### Real-Time Monitoring

Track all card activity in real-time including purchases, deposits, withdrawals, and card events. Get detailed transaction history with merchant information and categorization.

### Card Management

Full lifecycle management including card creation, funding, withdrawal, freezing, and unfreezing. Cards can be updated with new spending limits or restrictions as needed.

## Card Lifecycle

### Creating Cards

When you create a card, you specify the currency, brand (Mastercard or Visa), initial funding amount, and the customer it's assigned to. The card is created instantly and can be used immediately.

### Funding Cards

Add funds to cards from your business wallet at any time. Deposits are processed instantly and the card balance is updated immediately.

### Card Usage

Cards can be used for online purchases, in-store payments, and other transactions. All transactions are tracked and reported in real-time.

### Withdrawing Funds

Retrieve funds from cards back to your business wallet when needed. Withdrawals reduce the card balance accordingly.

### Freezing and Unfreezing

Temporarily disable cards by freezing them. Frozen cards cannot be used until they are unfrozen. This is useful for security purposes or when you need to temporarily disable a card.

## Card Information

Each card includes detailed information such as:

- Card number (masked for security)
- Expiration date
- CVV (available through reveal endpoint)
- Cardholder name
- Billing address
- Card status (active, frozen, cancelled)

## Security

### Sensitive Data Protection

Card numbers and CVVs are protected and only revealed through a secure, rate-limited endpoint. The reveal endpoint is rate limited to prevent abuse.

### Transaction Monitoring

All card transactions are monitored and logged. Unusual activity can trigger alerts and automatic card freezing.
